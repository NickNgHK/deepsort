*Deep Learning the Sorting Algorithm*

The sorting algorithm in deep learning can be considered O(N^2).
So it is not very exciting.
But it becomes exciting when it can learn to solve NP-hard problems!

## Models

Right now the current model uses seq2seq basic rnn.
Later, it can be improved using Pointer Networks.

Stay tuned for more implementations.
